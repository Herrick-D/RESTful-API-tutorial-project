# RESTful-API-tutorial-project
This is a tutorial I'm following to learn how to write a RESTful API using PHP

To run:
Open XAMPP or your preferred localhost server program that contains a MySQL server.

If you are new to XAMPP, to see the program running on your localhost, you must save or copy all project files to the folder XAMPP/htdocs/dashboard/YOUR-OWN-FOLDER-HERE. You will have to open the program files or traverse the XAMPP folders to the dashboard folder before you can create a new folder.

Once all the files are saved in your folder, make sure XAMPP is running and the MySQL Database and Apache Web Server are both running.

Then open a browser and go to localhost/dashboard/YOUR-FOLDER/ and you should be able to check out the program.
